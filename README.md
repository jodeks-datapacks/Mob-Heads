    <summary>How to Enable Cheats Permanently After World Creation</summary>

If you encounter this issue, here is a step by step guide on how to enable Cheats/Admincommands permanently after you have already created a Minecraft world.

⚠️ **Before you begin, you should save and backup your world in case something goes wrong.**  
(I will not take any responsibility for any corrupt worlds. Do this at your own risk!)  
But don't worry this works without any problems.  
If you don't want to change this permanently check out [this guide](#).

### 1. You need [NBTExplorer](https://github.com/jaquadro/NBTExplorer/releases/tag/v2.8.0-win)
> NBTExplorer is an open-source NBT editor for all common sources of NBT data. It's mainly intended for editing Minecraft game data.
 
### 2. Open NBTExplorer and open your Minecraft world, where you want to enable Cheats/Admincommands.

  <summary>How to Install a Mod on a Minecraft Server</summary>

### Step-by-Step Guide to Installing a Mod on a Minecraft Server

1. **Download the Mod**  
   - Make sure to download the **correct version** of the Mod that matches your server's Minecraft version.
   - **Important:** The mod file should be a `.jar` file.

2. **Ensure No Datapacks or Other Mods Conflict**  
   - Do not have both a datapack and a mod installed at the same time, as they may conflict.
   - Only install one or the other, depending on your server's setup.

3. **Locate the Mods Folder**  
   - Open your server's root directory.
   - Inside this directory, find the folder named `mods`.  
   - If the `mods` folder doesn't exist, create one.

4. **Install the Mod**  
   - Paste the downloaded `.jar` file for the Mod into the `mods` folder.

5. **Restart the Server**  
   - After adding the Mod to the `mods` folder, restart your Minecraft server for the mod to be activated.

6. **Verify Mod Installation**  
   - Once the server has restarted, join the server and check if the Mod is working.
   - You can use `/mods` or a similar command (depending on the mod) to see if the Mod has been successfully loaded.

### Additional Tips
- **Backup Your Server:** Always create a backup before installing the Mod to avoid data loss in case something goes wrong.
- **Ensure Mod Compatibility:** Check that the Mod is compatible with your Minecraft server version and any other mods you have installed.

```
data/minecraft/loot_tables/entities/entity.json
```


_in there, look for "conditions" and the condition "random_chance" and change the "chance" to the value in % you want the head to drop_
